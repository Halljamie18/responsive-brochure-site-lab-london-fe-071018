           <h2>Patty & Bun</h2>
             <p>Found it by googling 'best burger in london'. It was right. Not the cheapest, but excellent quality burger and have been back. Can't book so occasionally have to wait outside, but its worth it! <a href="https://www.pattyandbun.co.uk/restaurant-locations-overview/">Find Location</a></p>

            <h2>Bobo Social</h2>
             <p>I've been here twice now, once as a recce and the second for my retirement do. I chose the BOBO because my colleagues are vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian and full on omnivores, and the BOBO caters for them all. On both occasions I've been really impressed with the food and the service. We had the upstairs room and a dedicated waitress looking after our needs. <a href="https://www.quandoo.co.uk/place/bobo-social-42839?TC=EN_GB_SES_10001871&matchtype=e&network=g&device=c&keyword=bobo%20social&placement=&adposition=1t1&qpt=minimal&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIg4-5w4LK3AIVRj8bCh1_lggCEAAYASAAEgJ3IvD_BwE">Find Location</a></p>
